    <p>Quidditch is a mixed gender contact sport with a unique mix of elements from rugby, dodgeball, and tag. </br> A quidditch team is made up of seven athletes who play with brooms between their legs at all times. </br> While the game can appear chaotic to the casual observer, once familiar with the basic rules, quidditch is an exciting sport to watch and even more exciting to play.</p>

    <h2>How do you play?</h2>
    <p>There are four positions in quidditch; chaser, seeker, beater, and keeper.  The chasers try to score through the hoops with the quaffle, which is a slightly deflated volleyball. </br> The keepers try to defend these hoops from goals. </br> Beaters use bludgers, which are dodgeballs, to “beat” the opposing team, which forces beat players to run back to hoops. Finally, seekers work to end the game by catching the golden snitch.</p>

    <p>The Yule Ball is a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament. It is a formal dance held on the evening of Yule (the pagan Winter solstice/Christmas celebration) of a tournament year, and is opened by the tournament champions and their partners. </br> At Hogwarts, where the Yule Ball was held in 1994, only students of fourth year or above were permitted to attend, though younger students could also go if an older student invited them to accompany them. The ball begins at 8:00 p.m. and ends at midnight.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">3. Triwizard Cup </h2>

    <p>Triwizard is a tournament held at HGT with the aim of testing the Wizzard's Ability, Mentality and Intelligence. Each house is required to send only one representative. Dormitories that do not participate in this event will be subject to detention. </br> This tournament really requires hard work, enthusiasm and brain intelligence. There will be questions that test your brain abilities and in this tournament you will duel with your fellow students.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">4. Visit to Hogsmeade</h2>

    <p>Hogsmeade was a village built by a wizard named Hengist from Woodcroft. HGT students are allowed to visit this village at the end of the school year (every 3 months). </br> However, only students with a permission form from their parents or guardians are allowed to visit the village. Students will be invited to visit shops such as Zonko's Trick Shop and Honeydukes, or go to visit the Shrieking Shack.</p>
